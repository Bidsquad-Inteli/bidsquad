<br/>

## Scenario

In the global effort to combat climate change, carbon credits have emerged as a crucial mechanism to incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon emissions. BidSquad, a pioneering carbon credit auction platform, stands at the forefront of this movement, utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to facilitate reverse auctions for carbon credits. Let's delve into the key components of this innovative scenario:

1. **Carbon Credit Auctions**: BidSquad introduces a novel approach to carbon credit transactions through reverse auctions. In this setup, sellers of carbon credits, which can be individuals, businesses, or other entities, submit offers for the price at which they are willing to sell their carbon credits. Potential buyers, such as companies aiming to offset their emissions, then compete by submitting bids for the amount of credits they wish to purchase and the price they are willing to pay.
2. **Blockchain Technology**: BidSquad leverages the transparency and security of blockchain to create a trusted and tamper-proof platform. Every transaction, bid, and offer is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent and auditable record of carbon credit trading activities. This helps build trust among participants and enhances the integrity of the carbon credit market.
3. **Artificial Intelligence**: The platform employs advanced AI algorithms to optimize the auction process. AI analyzes historical data, market trends, and user behavior to provide insights that guide buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. This streamlines the auction process and enhances the efficiency of matching supply with demand.
4. **Environmental Impact**: BidSquad's primary goal is to contribute significantly to environmental preservation by facilitating the trading of carbon credits. Carbon credits represent measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and by enabling their purchase and sale, BidSquad supports efforts to combat climate change and encourages a more sustainable way of conducting business.
5. **Marketplace for Positive Change**: BidSquad creates a marketplace where participants can actively engage in environmental conservation. Sellers can monetize their carbon reduction efforts, while buyers can fulfill their emission reduction targets by purchasing credits from a diverse range of sources. This synergy fosters a community of sustainability-conscious individuals and organizations.
6. **Global Reach**: Climate change is a global issue, and BidSquad's platform provides an accessible and inclusive way for participants from around the world to participate in carbon credit trading. This fosters a broader impact by involving stakeholders from different regions and industries.
7. **Challenges and Growth**: While BidSquad's approach to carbon credit auctions is innovative, challenges such as market education, regulatory compliance, and scalability may arise. The platform's success hinges on effectively addressing these challenges and continuously refining its technology and processes.

In the dynamic landscape of environmental preservation and climate action, BidSquad emerges as a transformative platform that harnesses blockchain and AI technologies to foster a thriving marketplace for carbon credits. By providing a robust and transparent system for carbon credit auctions, BidSquad empowers individuals and organizations to actively contribute to a more sustainable future.

## Problem Definition

The fight against climate change and the pursuit of a more sustainable world are confronted with a myriad of complex and interconnected challenges. In the current context, the management and trade of carbon credits, while essential to incentivize greenhouse gas emissions reduction, also face significant obstacles. Some of the key difficulties and issues in existing solutions include:

1. **Lack of Transparency and Trust:** Traditional carbon credit trading systems often lack transparency and reliability. The absence of a clear system to trace the origin and authenticity of credits can lead to fraud and uncertainties regarding the actual effectiveness of emissions reductions.

2. **Complexity and Entry Barriers:** The intricate procedures for obtaining and certifying carbon credits can be discouraging for small businesses and projects. The bureaucracy involved in the validation and verification process can create substantial barriers to participation, limiting the reach of emissions reduction solutions.

3. **Lack of Standardization:** The lack of standardization across carbon trading systems worldwide hinders compatibility between different markets. This can make it difficult for stakeholders to understand the true value of credits and complicates the integration of effective global solutions.

4. **Risk of Fraud and Accounting Errors:** Accounting mistakes and lax verification can lead to the improper issuance of carbon credits. Additionally, credit forgery is a real concern that undermines trust in the system as a whole.

5. **Insufficient Incentives:** In some carbon trading systems, financial incentives for emissions reduction may not be substantial enough to drive significant behavioral changes in organizations. This could result in limited adoption of carbon reduction initiatives.

6. **Limited Access:** Many emissions reduction projects struggle to access carbon markets effectively. This is partly due to a lack of efficient distribution channels and platforms that can easily connect buyers and sellers of carbon credits.

7. **Lack of Public Engagement:** Current solutions often fail to meaningfully engage the general public. Public awareness and involvement are pivotal for long-term success in emissions reduction.

BidSquad aims to address these problems and challenges by introducing an innovative carbon credit auction platform. Leveraging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, BidSquad strives to establish a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy environment for carbon credit trading. This platform seeks to solve issues prevalent in traditional carbon trading solutions, fostering a more dynamic and effective market for promoting environmental sustainability.

## Dependencies

The BidSquad project utilizes the following key technologies and dependencies:

-   Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
-   Cartesi: A blockchain technology used for secure off-chain computation and smart contract execution.
-   Web3.js: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
-   **AI/ML Libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.): Used for AI-based carbon credit estimation.**

## How it Works

1. **User creates their property:** The user adds their property to the platform by marking its points (coordinates).

2. **Satellite Image Retrieval:** The platform retrieves a satellite image of the property using Google Earth, and this image is sent to the backend of the Cartesi dApp.

3. **AI Assessment:** The AI within Cartesi receives the satellite image and performs an evaluation of the area, estimating the potential carbon credit generation for that property.

4. **Carbon Credit Generation on the Blockchain:** Based on the AI assessment, the property's carbon credit potential is generated and recorded on the blockchain.

5. **Bidding from Certifiers:** The property is now ready to receive bids from carbon credit certifying companies. These companies make proposals for the payment value of their certification services, indicating their interest in validating the amount of carbon credits generated.

6. **Auction Closure:** At the end of the auction, the bidding process is closed, and the lowest bid wins the right to certify the carbon credits for the property.
