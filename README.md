## Introduction

BidSquad is a revolutionary carbon credit auction platform that leverages the power of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to facilitate reverse auctions for carbon credits. The platform aims to create a sustainable marketplace where individuals and organizations can contribute to environmental preservation by selling and purchasing carbon credits.

## Features

-   Add areas with potential carbon consumption using coordinates.
-   Advanced AI estimation of carbon credit potential for added areas.
-   Carbon certifiers can place competitive bids in reverse auctions.
-   Transparent and secure blockchain-based transaction system.
-   Sustainable projects are promoted through the acquisition of carbon credits.

## Dependencies

The BidSquad project utilizes the following key technologies and dependencies:

-   Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
-   Cartesi: A blockchain technology used for secure off-chain computation and smart contract execution.
-   Web3.js: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
-   **AI/ML Libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.): Used for AI-based carbon credit estimation.**

## How it Works

1. **User creates their property:** The user adds their property to the platform by marking its points (coordinates).

2. **Satellite Image Retrieval:** The platform retrieves a satellite image of the property using Google Earth, and this image is sent to the backend of the Cartesi dApp.

3. **AI Assessment:** The AI within Cartesi receives the satellite image and performs an evaluation of the area, estimating the potential carbon credit generation for that property.

4. **Carbon Credit Generation on the Blockchain:** Based on the AI assessment, the property's carbon credit potential is generated and recorded on the blockchain.

5. **Bidding from Certifiers:** The property is now ready to receive bids from carbon credit certifying companies who want to validate the amount of carbon credits generated.

6. **Auction Closure:** At the end of the auction, the bidding process is closed, and the highest bid wins the right to certify the carbon credits for the property.
