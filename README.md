### Reverse Auction Mechanism

BidSquad introduces an innovative reverse auction model tailored to the needs of landowners seeking carbon credit certification. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Auction Initiation:** Landowners initiate the process by creating an auction for their preserved area. During auction setup, the landowner establishes a maximum budget they are willing to allocate for carbon credit certification.

2. **Certifier Bidding:** Certifiers, experts in carbon credit assessments, actively participate in the auction by submitting reverse bids. They propose the price they would require for certifying the carbon credit emissions associated with the landowner's preserved area.

3. **Winning Bidder Determination:** The certifier presenting the lowest reverse bid emerges as the winner of the reverse auction. This bid represents the price the certifier is willing to accept for their professional certification services.

4. **Payment Process:** Following the conclusion of the auction, the payment process is initiated. The successful certifier receives the bid amount from the initial deposit made by the landowner. Any remaining funds are promptly refunded to the landowner. For instance, if the landowner deposited 50 ETH and the winning bid is 40 ETH, the certifier receives 40 ETH, while the remaining 10 ETH are returned to the landowner.

## Problem Definition

The fight against climate change and the pursuit of a more sustainable world are marked by a complex web of interconnected challenges. In the current landscape, the management and trade of carbon credits, critical for incentivizing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, grapple with substantial obstacles. Some of the key difficulties and issues in existing solutions include:

1. **Lack of Transparency and Trust:** Traditional systems for carbon credit trading often suffer from opacity and a lack of credibility. Without a transparent mechanism to trace the lineage and authenticity of credits, the potential for fraud looms large. This uncertainty undermines the confidence in emissions reduction efforts and raises questions about the actual impact achieved.

2. **Complexity and Entry Barriers:** The intricate processes involved in obtaining and certifying carbon credits can be daunting, particularly for small businesses and projects. The intricate validation and verification procedures create formidable barriers to participation, limiting the accessibility of emissions reduction strategies.

3. **Lack of Standardization:** The absence of standardized practices across global carbon trading systems introduces compatibility challenges between different markets. This disparity makes it challenging for stakeholders to assess the true value of credits and complicates the integration of effective solutions on a global scale.

## Solution

The **BidSquad** platform emerged from the need to streamline the connection between environmental conservators, such as farmers, and carbon credit certifying entities. To achieve this, **BidSquad** offers key features that redefine the process of carbon credit certification and trading. Below are the core components of the solution provided by the platform:

### Auction Creation

For individuals and entities engaged in preserving green areas, **BidSquad** offers an innovative way to initiate carbon credit auctions. These auctions serve as a means to connect environmental advocates with carbon credit certifiers. Participants can create auctions, specifying the details of the preserved green area and auction conditions, such as duration and end date. Certifiers, in turn, can competitively bid, indicating the value they are willing to offer for their certification services. **BidSquad** promotes healthy competition, ensuring that the certifier with the lowest bid emerges as the winner.

### Area Definition and Image Recognition

A key innovation of **BidSquad** is its integration with image recognition and geolocation technology. Farmers and advocates of green areas can input the geographic coordinates of their preserved areas into the platform. Utilizing the Google Maps API, the system automatically retrieves a satellite image of the region, converting it into base64 format, which is then forwarded to Cartesi's infrastructure through the input contract. Internally, the platform employs artificial intelligence for image recognition, analyzing the satellite image to determine the extent of the green area. This analysis is crucial for calculating the number of carbon credit tokens associated with the area.

### Payment Process

**BidSquad** ensures that the payment and financing process for carbon credit auctions is transparent and efficient. Participants, upon providing coordinates and relevant details, also indicate the amount they are willing to pay for certification services. This amount is deposited in ethers into the EtherPortal contract, ensuring that funds are securely held and accessible throughout the auction process. Certifiers, identified by their wallets, participate in the auction by bidding according to the terms set by the auction creator. Once the auction concludes, the auction creator has the option to finalize it, initiating the next phase.

### Finalization and Value Distribution

Concluding an auction marks the final phase in the **BidSquad** process. At this point, the system generates vouchers that facilitate the transfer of agreed-upon values between the auction creator and the winning certifier. This transfer is conducted securely and automatically, ensuring that the certifier receives payment for their rendered services. Additionally, any remaining funds that were not allocated to the winning certifier are returned to the auction creator, maintaining transparency and fairness for all involved parties.

By integrating these innovative elements, **BidSquad** creates a comprehensive and effective solution for connecting environmental conservators with carbon credit certifiers. The platform simplifies complex processes, streamlines transactions, and fosters mutual trust among participants. With blockchain technology and artificial intelligence as foundational pillars, **BidSquad** is paving the way for a more dynamic, transparent, and accessible carbon credit market, thus contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.
